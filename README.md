Sudoku-like puzzle game. Fill in the correct numbers to solve the puzzle.

<strong>How To</strong>

The puzzle consists of numbers along the outside of a circle. The circle is separated by the top half and the bottom half, and numbers from the top half are connected to numbers on the bottom half via a line. Depending on the size of the puzzle ('X'), there will be 'X' numbers on the top half, and 'X' numbers on the bottom half of the circle. Some of the numbers will not be filled in. The goal is to fill in the missing numbers based on the rest of the puzzle to correctly solve it.

<strong>Rules</strong>
<ul>
  <li>No duplicate numbers on the top half. No duplicate numbers on the bottom half.</li>
  <li>If two numbers are connected by a line, they cannot be the same value.</li>
<li>Each number on one half of the circle must be equal to one of the numbers on the opposite half of the circle which it's line intersects.</li>
</ul>
